# Zoom-Room-Controls_JSON
This is a handful of JSON config files that are added to a Zoom Room account, and allow low cost access and control of AV hardware. This is a very inexpensive way to add additional control to a 'plug and play' Zoom Room, with a slight bit of development and a few small pieces of hardware.
